```{r}
trees <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmcglinn/quant_methods/gh-pages/data/treedata_subset.csv')
```

1. Carry out an exploratory analysis using the tree dataset. Metadata for the tree study can be found here. Specifically, I would like you to develop and compare models for species cover for a habitat generalist Acer rubrum (Red maple) and a habitat specialist Abies fraseri (Frasier fir). Because this dataset includes both continuous and discrete explanatory variables use the function Anova in the packages car as such

```{r}
install.packages('car')
```
